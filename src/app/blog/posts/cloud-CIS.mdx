## Introduction

As governments and organisations modernise public services, many are turning to the cloud to manage critical infrastructure — the systems that provide water, electricity, transport, and more. Cloud technologies offer powerful tools for resilience, scalability, and real-time threat detection, but they also introduce unique risks such as misconfigurations, insider threats, and accountability gaps.

In this post, I summarise findings from a literature review I conducted exploring how cloud computing enhances — and complicates — critical infrastructure security.

## Benefits of Using the Cloud for Critical Infrastructure Security

Cloud providers like AWS and Azure offer purpose-built services that strengthen core infrastructure:

- Real-time threat detection using AI (Joyce, 2024)

- Elastic scalability during high-traffic events or DDoS attacks (van Niekerk & Jacobs, 2013)

- Centralised visibility via tools like AWS GuardDuty or Microsoft Defender

These capabilities improve operational uptime and reduce the burden on human operators. For instance, AWS Shield automatically detects and mitigates DDoS attacks without requiring manual intervention — something that’s hard to match in traditional on-prem setups.

## Security Threats in the cloud environment

However, cloud adoption isn’t without its risks:

- Misconfiguration is the #1 cause of breaches (SentinelOne, 2024)

- The Capital One breach (2019) was caused by a misconfigured Web Application Firewall, exploited by a former AWS employee (Khan et al., 2022)

- Shared responsibility confusion leaves some users unaware of what they’re actually responsible for

There’s also concern over accountability: if something goes wrong, is the cloud provider liable? What if SLAs aren't well defined?

## 3. Mitigation strategies

To counter these risks, the literature supports a layered approach:

- Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): assume breach, enforce least privilege, and require identity-based access (NIST, 2020)

- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools like Azure Defender help detect misconfigurations early

- Hybrid security models combine the resilience of cloud with the control of on-prem infrastructure

The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack is a perfect case study: although it hit on-prem systems, the exploited flaws — like lack of MFA — are just as relevant in the cloud (Imprivata, 2022).

## Conclusion

The cloud offers incredible advantages for securing critical infrastructure — but only if organisations understand the tradeoffs and build layered defences. Future research should explore how real-world hybrid environments perform, and which governance frameworks help prevent failures like Capital One or Colonial Pipeline.
