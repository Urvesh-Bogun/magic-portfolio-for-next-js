## Introduction

As governments increasingly rely on technology to facilitate public services, security of critical infrastructure becomes a priority.
In this post, I summarise a literature review I wrote, in which I explore how migration to the cloud acts as both an enhancement and a risk to critical infrastructures.

## Benefits of Using the Cloud for Critical Infrastructure Security

Cloud providers like AWS and Azure offer services that can help improve the security posture of critical infrastructures:

- [Real-time threat detection using AI](https://cloudmonitor.ai/2024/11/how-ai-powered-cloud-monitoring-helps-prevent-downtime-and-data-loss/)

- [Elastic scalability during high-traffic events or DDoS attacks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6707515?arnumber=6707515)

- [Real-time visibility and misconfiguration detection tools like AWS GuardDuty](https://www.cloudoptimo.com/blog/aws-guardduty-advanced-threat-detection-for-cloud-security/)

These benefits increase uptime and reduce the workload on staff by utilising cloud automation and workflows.

## Security Threats in the cloud environment

However, cloud adoption also has its fair share of risks:

- [Misconfiguration is the #1 cause of breaches in the cloud](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/cloud-security-statistics/#cloud-misconfigurations-statistics)

- [The Capital One breach (2019) was caused by a misconfigured Web Application Firewall, exploited by a former AWS employee](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3546068)

- [Shared responsibility confusion leaves some users unaware of thier security responsibilities](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3546068)

If something goes wrong, is the cloud provider liable? What if SLAs aren't well defined?

## 3. Mitigation strategies

To mitigate these risks, academics supports a layered approach:

- [Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): assume breach, enforce least privilege, and require identity-based access](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf)

- [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools like Azure Defender help detect misconfigurations early](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/business/security-101/what-is-cspm#layout-container-uid4f163)

- [Hybrid security models combine the resilience of cloud with the control of on-prem infrastructure](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6707515?arnumber=6707515)

The [Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack](https://www.imprivata.com/uk/node/103640) is a notable case study: although it hit on-prem systems, the exploited flaws — like lack of MFA — are just as relevant in the cloud

## Conclusion

The cloud offers significant advantages for critical infrastructure security, but only if organisations are aware prepared to mitigate the drawbacks. Future research should explore how hybrid setups perform, and deeper studies into specific critical infrastructures and the cloud.
