## Secure Coding

Secure coding is writing code that protects against security issues.

## 1. Input Validation

**Why:** Prevents SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows.

**What to do:** Ensure all user inputs are clean, expected, and safe:

- Validate on both client and server  
- Use whitelisting  
- Sanitise inputs

## 2. Secure Communication

**Why:** Stops data interception in transit.

**What to do:** Enforce secure data transmission:

- Enforce HTTPS in your app logic
- Use secure HTTP clients 
- Validate certificates in code

## 3. Use Trusted Libraries & Frameworks

**Why:** Reduces the risk of bugs and vulnerabilities.

**What to do:** Use secure, maintained libraries:

- Pick well-supported libraries
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use tools to scan for dependency vulnerabilities

## 4. Authentication & Authorisation

**Why:** Prevents unauthorised access.

**What to do:** Implement identity and access checks:

- Check permissions in backend, not just frontend
- Apply least privilege logic in code

## 5. Password Handling

**Why:** Prevents account takeovers.

**What to do:** Code should never store passwords insecurely:

- Hash passwords 
- Use salts
- Never log or store plain-text passwords

## 6. Avoid Hardcoded Secrets

**Why:** Prevents credential leaks.

**What to do:** Never include API keys, credentials, or secrets directly in your code:

- Use environment variables in your code
- Load secrets securely at runtime

## 7. Error Handling & Logging

**Why:** Prevents info leaks to users or logs.

**What to do:** Handle and log errors securely in code:

- Return generic error messages to users
- Log internally with context but mask sensitive info
- Avoid stack traces or database errors in responses

## Conclusion

Security starts in the code. These practices help prevent vulnerabilities before they become real threats.
