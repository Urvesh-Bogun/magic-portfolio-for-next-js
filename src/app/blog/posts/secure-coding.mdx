## Secure Coding

Secure coding is writing code that protects against security issues.

## 1. Input Validation

**Why:** Prevents SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows.

**What to do:** Ensure all user inputs are expected and safe:

- Validate on both client and server  
- Use whitelisting  
- Sanitise inputs

## 2. Authentication & Authorisation

**Why:** Prevents unauthorised access.

**What to do:** Implement identity and access checks:

- Check permissions in both frontend and backend
- Apply least privilege logic in code

## 3. Password Handling

**Why:** Prevents account takeovers.

**What to do:** Never store passwords insecurely:

- Hash passwords 
- Use salts
- Never log or store passwords in plain-text

## 4. Avoid Hardcoded Secrets

**Why:** Prevents credential leaks.

**What to do:** Never include secrets directly in your code:

- Use environment variables in your code
- Load secrets securely at runtime

## 5. Error Handling & Logging

**Why:** Prevents info leaks to users or logs.

**What to do:** Handle and log errors securely in code:

- Return generic error messages to users
- Log internally but hide sensitive info
- Avoid stack traces in responses

## Conclusion

Security starts in the code. These practices help prevent vulnerabilities before they become real threats.
