## Introduction

Knowing which cloud services matter most can help you build faster without managing physical hardware.

Here are 4 foundational cloud services that every developer, engineer, or security analyst should know.

## 1. Virtual Machines (VMs)

- **What it does**: With a VM you can run code, hosts web servers, and simulate on-premise environments.

- **Why use it**: Testing, security labs, or running apps that aren’t compatible with serverless platforms.

- **Examples**: AWS EC2, Azure Virtual Machines, and Google Compute Engine.

## 2. Object Stores

- **What it does**: Object storage allows you to store unstructured data like images, backups, PDFs, or logs.

- **Why use it**: It’s perfect for large-scale storage needs.

- **Examples**: Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage.

## 3. Database Services

- **What it does**: Managed database services let you store, query, and manage structured data like user profiles and financial records.

- **Why use it**: Saves time and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities caused by misconfigurations.

- **Examples**: Amazon RDS / DynamoDB, Azure SQL Database / Cosmos DB, and Google Cloud Firestore

## 4. Functions as a Services (FaaS)

- **What it does**: FaaS lets you automatically run blocks of code in response to events (e.g. a user signs up).

- **Why use it**: Ideal for automation. It’s cost-effective because you only pay when the code runs.

- **Examples**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions

## Conclusion

These four services offer compute, storage, data, and execution. Understanding these is key to building secure and scalable applications.
