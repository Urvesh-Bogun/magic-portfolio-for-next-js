## Overview

This project involved deploying a lightweight SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system using Microsoft Sentinel on Azure. The goal was to monitor activity on a virtual machine and receive real-time alerts.

## Key Features

- **Virtual Machine Setup**: Deployed and hardened a Linux-based VM on Azure for testing monitoring and alerting use cases.
- **Azure Log Analytics Integration**: Connected the VM to an Azure Log Analytics workspace to ingest log data.
- **Microsoft Sentinel Configuration**: Enabled Sentinel on the workspace to gain access to SIEM features including workbooks, analytics, and incident tracking.
- **Custom Alert Rules**: Created alert rules that trigger notifications on specified events — e.g., successful SSH logins.

## Technologies Used

- **Microsoft Azure**

- **Azure Log Analytics Workspace**

- **Linux Virtual Machine**

- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** for writing detection rules


## Challenges and Learnings

Initially, the laptop in my network wasn’t receiving an IP address. After checking the DHCP settings on the server, I realised the IP address didn’t match the router’s subnet. This stopped IP allocation.

I resolved the issue by updating the DHCP pool to match the router's network range and restarting the DHCP service. After this fix, all devices received valid IP addresses.

## Outcome

Successfully built a working SIEM setup that can monitor real-world virtual machines and raise alerts on key events.

This project demonstrates my ability to understanding of security monitoring, threat detection, and how SIEM platforms work in a practical cloud environment.
