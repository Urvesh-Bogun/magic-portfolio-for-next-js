## Overview

Pet Suggester is an interactive Java program that helps users decide on a new pet. It uses a binary decision tree to ask yes/no questions and make pet suggestions. If a user isn’t satisfied with a suggestion, the program learns by asking for a better pet and a new distinguishing question—updating the tree accordingly.

The goal was to demonstrate recursive data structures, file I/O, exception handling, and core Java skills.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Question Tree**: Built with recursive TreeNode objects, supporting both questions and pet suggestions.

- **Learning Logic**: Automatically expands its tree when the user rejects a suggestion, storing new pets and questions.

- **File Save & Load**: Saves the decision tree to suggestions.txt and loads it back in future sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** to code OOP project

- **BufferedReader / BufferedWriter** for file I/O

- **Scanner** for user input

- **Recursive algorithms** for traversing and building the decision tree

## Challenges and Learnings

Learned how small errors in tree traversal logic can break recursive flows

Gained practical experience with Java file I/O and exception handling

## Outcome

By the end of the project, I had built a fully functional decision-making assistant in Java that evolves over time based on user feedback. It’s a simple concept, but a great demonstration of recursion, file persistence, and interactive logic in a command-line setting.
