## Introduction

As governments rely more heavily on technology to deliver public services, securing critical infrastructure has become a top priority. In this post, I summarise a literature review I conducted, looking at how migrating to the cloud introduces both benefits and risks for critical systems.

## Benefits of Using the Cloud for Critical Infrastructure Security

Cloud providers like AWS and Azure offer services that can help improve the security posture of critical infrastructures through:

- [Real-time threat detection using AI](https://cloudmonitor.ai/2024/11/how-ai-powered-cloud-monitoring-helps-prevent-downtime-and-data-loss/)

- [Elastic scalability for traffic spikes](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6707515?arnumber=6707515)

- [Tools like AWS GuardDuty that help detect misconfigurations and improve visibility](https://www.cloudoptimo.com/blog/aws-guardduty-advanced-threat-detection-for-cloud-security/)

These benefits increase uptime and reduce the workload on staff by automating security tasks.

## Security Threats in the cloud environment

However, cloud adoption also has its downsides:

- [Misconfigurations are the leading cause of cloud breaches](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/cloud-security-statistics/#cloud-misconfigurations-statistics)

- [The 2019 Capital One breach involved a former AWS employee exploiting a misconfigured firewall](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3546068)

- [The shared responsibility model can lead to confusion over who’s responsible for what](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3546068)

If something goes wrong, who’s to blame? What happens if the service level agreements (SLAs) aren’t clearly defined?

## 3. Mitigation strategies

To mitigate these risks, academics suggest using a layered approach:

- [Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): assume breach, enforce least privilege, and require fine-grained access control](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf)

- [Use Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools like Azure Defender to help detect misconfigurations early](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/security/business/security-101/what-is-cspm#layout-container-uid4f163)

- [Hybrid security models combine the resilience of cloud with the control of on-prem systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6707515?arnumber=6707515)

## Conclusion

The cloud offers significant advantages for critical infrastructure security, but only if organisations are prepared to mitigate the drawbacks. Future research should explore how hybrid setups perform, and deeper studies into how well specific critical infrastructures work together with the cloud.
