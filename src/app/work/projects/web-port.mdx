## Overview

A hardened Next.js portfolio on AWS: S3 + CloudFront, and Route 53, with a Python Lambda to update a view counter on DynamoDB, created using Terraform

## Key Features

- **AWS Security Features**: TLS via ACM, OWASP mitigation via WAF, log encryption via KMS, threat monitoring via GuardDuty, and logging via CloudTrail

- **IaC**: Terraform for IAM roles/policies, Lambda, DynamoDB, and outputs.

- **Delivery**: CI/CD with S3 sync and CloudFront cache invalidation

## Technologies Used

- AWS, Terraform, GitHub Actions, Next.js

## Challenges and Learnings

This project was my first experience using IaC, resulting in being lost until I found (this helpful resource)[https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs].

## Outcome

A secure, serverless portfolio with an automated pipeline and a Lambda-powered view counter.
