## Overview



## Key Features

- **AWS Security Features**: Built with recursive TreeNode objects, supporting both questions and pet suggestions.

- **IaC**: Automatically expands its tree when the user rejects a suggestion, storing new pets and questions.

- **Pyscripts**: Saves the decision tree to suggestions.txt and loads it back in future sessions.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS** to code OOP project

- **Terraform** for file I/O

- **GitHub Actions** for user input

- **Next.js** 

## Challenges and Learnings

This project was my first experience using IaC, and with that I struggled to get the right cobnfigurations for 

## Outcome

By the end of the project, I had built a fully functional decision-making assistant in Java that evolves over time based on user feedback. Itâ€™s a simple concept, but a great demonstration of recursion, file persistence, and interactive logic in a command-line setting.
