## Overview

CatCoin is a lightweight Python simulation of a blockchain — built to demonstrate how transactions are securely linked across blocks using cryptographic hashes. Each block stores a list of transactions, links back to the previous block’s hash, and computes its own hash based on that data.

## Key Features

- **Block Hashing with SHA-256**: Uses SHA-256 cryptographic hashing to securely link blocks, ensuring data integrity and immutability across the blockchain.

- **Chained Block Structure**: Each block contains a hash of the previous block, creating an unbreakable chain that guarantees the security and continuity of the transaction history.

- **Transaction History**: Stores a complete, tamper-proof history of transactions, with each transaction being verified by the cryptographic hash of the previous block.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**

- **hashlib** for cryptographic hashing


## Challenges and Learnings

- **Immutability in blockchains**: how changing one block breaks the chain

- Practiced creating custom classes and chaining objects logically

## Outcome

This mini-project gave me a clear, low-level understanding of blockchain fundamentals, including hash chaining and transaction history.
