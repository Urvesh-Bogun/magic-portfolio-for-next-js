## Overview

CatCoin is a lightweight Python simulation of a blockchain — built to demonstrate how transactions are securely linked across blocks using cryptographic hashes. Each block stores a list of transactions, links back to the previous block’s hash, and computes its own hash based on that data.

## Key Features

- **Block Hashing with SHA-256**: Created a network with a PC, laptop, wireless router, cable modem, and server.
- **Chained Block Structure**: Configured DHCP and DNS for seamless network communication and automatic IP addressing.
- **Transaction History**: Established a secure wireless network (SSID) for laptop connectivity.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**

- **hashlib** for cryptographic hashing


## Challenges and Learnings

- **Immutability in blockchains**: how changing one block breaks the chain

- Practiced creating custom classes and chaining objects logically

## Outcome

This mini-project gave me a clear, low-level understanding of blockchain fundamentals, including hash chaining and transaction history.

This project demonstrates my understanding of how blockchains work under the hood — without relying on any third-party libraries or frameworks.
