## Overview

In this project, I developed Python implementations of three financial models to price options. These tools help estimate the fair value of European and American calls and puts. This is a foundational topic in computational finance and quantitative trading.

## Key Features

- **Black Scholes Model**: Calculates the price of European call and put options using a formula. It's fast and assumes no early exercise or dividends.
- **Binomial Trees**: Breaks down the option into steps and maps out all the possible price movements. It’s useful for American options as it handles early exercise.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Simulates random price paths and uses the average result to estimate what an option is worth. It’s slower, but more flexible.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Language used for building models and simulations.

## Challenges and Learnings

Learned how small changes in model parameters (like volatility or time step) significantly impact pricing accuracy.

Gained hands-on experience translating mathematical models into code.

Understood where each model is most effective: Black-Scholes for speed, Binomial for handling American options, and Monte Carlo for flexibility.

## Outcome

This project enhanced my understanding of computational finance fundamentals.
