## Overview

In this project, I created a Home Network using Cisco Packet Tracer to learn more about networking

## Key Features

- **Network Design and Implementation**: Created a network with a PC, laptop, wireless router, cable modem, and server.
- **DNS and DHCP**: Configured DHCP and DNS for seamless network communication and automatic IP addressing.
- **SSID**: Established a secure wireless network (SSID) for laptop connectivity.
- **Server Implementation**: Set up a Cisco.com server as DHCP and DNS server to manage IP allocation and domain resolution
- **Final Touches**: Verified network integrity and device communication through command-line connectivity tests

## Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: For network design, implementation and troubleshooting.

## Challenges and Learnings

Initially, the laptop in my network wasn’t receiving an IP address. After checking the DHCP settings on the server, I realised the IP address didn’t match the router’s subnet. This stopped IP allocation.

I resolved the issue by updating the DHCP pool to match the router's network range and restarting the DHCP service. After this fix, all devices received valid IP addresses.

## Outcome

A fully functioning simulated home network with automatic IP addressing, wireless connectivity, and domain name resolution.
